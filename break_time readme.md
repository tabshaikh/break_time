Break App
Think of a friend who works on a computer researching for hours. Well that person could be you. This could be a problem as the number of hours on a computer keeps on going up. To take timely breaks you could set an alarm on your smartphones but how amazing would it be to built your own alarm system which schedules breaks throughout the day reminding you to listen to music, get up and dance or just take some time away from computer.
